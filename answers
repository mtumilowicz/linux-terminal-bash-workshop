        ln -s file2 file2-soft
    1. verify they were created
        ls -l
        file1
        file1-hard
        file2
        file2-soft -> file2
    1. change the name of file1 and verify the hard link
        mv file1 file1-new
        cat file1-hard
        Cat
    1. change the name of file2 and verify the soft link
        mv file2 file2-new
        cat file2-soft
        cat: file2-soft: No such file or directory
    1. delete the file1-new and verify the hard link
        rm file1-new
        cat file1-hard
        Cat
    1. create file3 and soft link, then delete file3 and verify the soft link

    * find row number for ids, that has more than one TRACE entry
        * grep TRACE sample.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr | awk '$1 > 1 { print $2 }' | grep -f - -n sample.log
