1. filesystem task
    1. create two files:
       touch file1
       touch file2
    1. enter some data into them
       echo "Cat" > file1
       echo "Dog" > file2
    1. verify the content of the files
       cat file1; cat file2
       Cat
       Dog
    1. create hard and soft links
       ln file1 file1-hard
       ln -s file2 file2-soft
    1. verify they were created
       ls -l
       file1
       file1-hard
       file2
       file2-soft -> file2
    1. change the name of file1 and verify the hard link
       mv file1 file1-new
       cat file1-hard
       Cat
    1. change the name of file2 and verify the soft link
       mv file2 file2-new
       ls file2-soft
       file2-soft
       cat file2-soft
       cat: file2-soft: No such file or directory
    1. delete the file1-new and verify the hard link
        rm file1-new
        cat file1-hard
        Cat
    1. delete the file2 and verify the soft link
        rm file2-new
        cat file2-soft
        cat: file2-soft: No such file or directory

### terminal
* task1
    * tty
        * open two terminals
        * type `tty` in each
        * in terminal1
            * cat < test.txt > /dev/pts/1 // address of terminal2
        * in terminal2 - it should appear
* task2
    * analyze files/sample.log
    * how many FATAL logs
        * grep ERROR sample.log
    * find if for any id there is more than one TRACE entry
        * grep TRACE sample.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr | awk '$1 > 1 { print }'
    * find row number for that id, that has more than one TRACE entry
        * grep TRACE sample.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr | awk '$1 > 1 { print $2 }' | grep -f - -n sample.log

### bash
* create 100 dir with 100 files each and put needle.txt somewhere
    * mkdir directory{1..100}
        * verify count dir: find . -maxdepth 1 | wc -l
    * touch directory{1..100}/file{1..100}.txt
        * verify count dir: find . -mindepth 2 | wc -l
    * create needle.txt somewhere in dirs
        * touch directory$(shuf -i 1-100 -n 1)/needle.txt
        * verify that exists find . -name needle.txt
    * rm -r directory{1..100}
* find that file and move to from its dir to parent dir (files)
    * find . -type f -name "needle.txt" -exec mv {} . \;
    * verify that it was moved find . -name needle.txt
